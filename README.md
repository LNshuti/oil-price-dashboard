# Oil Prices Dashboard
This repository attempts to reproduce Sean Taylor's tutorial on LineAPy(2). As an enchancement, I built a dashboard that tracks live global oil prices based on Sean's tutorial. The goal of building this project is to familiarize myself with unit testing, continuous integration/delivery, and building a full stack application with python.
